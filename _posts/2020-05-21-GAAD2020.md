Thursday, May 21 2020, marks the ninth [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/). The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital access/inclusion and people with different disabilities.

The Digital team will celebrate the day with a session opened to all the Scottish Enterprise staff.

## On the day
We will have a quiz (hope to be able to share here) and have short presentations:

- Accessibility (what it is)
- Invisible disabilities – what they are and how it affects people
- What SE is doing – both for the staff and for our customers
- Make your social media posts accessible – (how to)
- Assisted digital users – who they are and how we support them
- Simple things you can do and apply at work

We will share the slides of the presentation for the day and other resources here after the event. Watch this space!
