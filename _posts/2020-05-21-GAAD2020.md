Thursday, May 21 2020, marks the ninth [Global Accessibility Awareness Day (GAAD)](https://globalaccessibilityawarenessday.org/). The purpose of GAAD is to get everyone talking, thinking and learning about digital access/inclusion and people with different disabilities.

The Digital team will celebrate the day with a session opened to all the Scottish Enterprise staff.

## On the day
We had a quiz (sorry can't share here) and had short presentations:

- Accessibility (what it is)
- Invisible disabilities – what they are and how it affects people
- What Scottish Enterprise is doing – both for the staff and for our customers
- Make your social media posts accessible – (how to)
- Assisted digital users – who they are and how we support them
- Simple things you can do and apply at work

The [slides of the presentation from this morning session for all staff can be downloaded](/images/a11y/GAAD2020-presentation-for-the-public.pdf). 
There are lots of links to resources in there, so have a look.

Other resources will be added here. Watch this space!
