When you hear 'disability' you usually think: Wheelchair. But In the UK, 93–95% of people with disabilities are not wheelchair users.

## What is an invisible disability?
The Invisible Disabilities Association says:

>An invisible disability is a physical, mental or neurological condition that is not visible from the outside, yet can limit or challenge a person’s movements, senses, or activities.

Symptoms can be debilitating pain, fatigue, dizziness, cognitive dysfunctions, learning differences, mental health disorders, or hearing and vision impairments for example. They can limits your daily activities.

These can come from a wide range of conditions like Fibromyalgia, Crohn’s disease, Multiple Sclerosis (M.S.), Autism, Anxiety, Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (M.E. also known as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), Lupus, and many more…

They regularly face problems in public places and at work because people don't realise there are some things they can't do.

## Public places: Priority seats in transports, accessible toilets and disabled parking spaces

It’s easy to find articles about people with invisible disabilities being treated badly by the public assuming they are abusing the system.

## Some initiatives are trying to help

### Blue badge
The [Blue Badge scheme has been extended](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/people-with-hidden-disabilities-to-benefit-from-blue-badges) to hidden disabilities, including autism and mental health conditions.

### In the transports
For example, [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/transport-accessibility/please-offer-me-a-seat) created a badge and a card stating “Please offer me a seat”. You don’t have to prove you need it. It can empower some people to ask for a seat and if you’re lucky, someone might notice it and you might not even have to ask. But a lot of people using it seem to still feel judged or get weird looks.

> “I’ve only used it a few times, when I have, I can just feel people staring at me, I’ve never used it when the trains have been particularly busy so couldn’t say whether it actually works or not, but I’ve never felt more judged.”

‘Happy to move for you’ is the [same idea but for people who are happy to offer their seat](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/happy-to-move-for-you-tube-badge-for-people-with-hidden-illnesses-to-be-rolled-out-across-uk-a4276381.html) to someone who might need it. Ellie Kime came up with this badge:
