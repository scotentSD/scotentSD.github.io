A short post to help define these terms

## Accessibility
Usually, when they hear "Accessibility" most people think: screen readers, wheelchairs, and more recently they might even think of dyslexia for example. But there is much more to it:

### In the UK, 1 in 5 people have a disability

The concept of accessibility doesn’t just apply to people with disabilities — all users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances.

The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/topics/disabilities/en/) defines disability as:

>_“a mismatch in interaction between the features of a person’s body and the features of the environment in which they live.”_

The impairment can be permanent, temporary or situational, but in the end, it’s the same requirements:

## Assisted Digital - Digital exclusion

Sometimes people need help to use services online. This is known as [assisted digital support](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/helping-people-to-use-your-service/assisted-digital-support-introduction#users-who-need-assisted-digital-support).

Any user may need assisted digital support, if they lack:

- trust in your service or the internet
- confidence to use an online service themselves
- access to the internet
- digital skills
- motivation to overcome these barriers on their own

A recent study shows that **almost one-fifth of Britons ‘do not use internet’.**

In [this article, from the BBC](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-49607061), you get a better idea of the various reasons why people don’t use internet:

10% do not use the net because of privacy worries
40% of those earning less than £12,500 do not go online
70% of all respondents “uncomfortable” with targeted advertising and data tracking
12% have been hit by computer viruses
11% got abusive emails

### Just like for accessibility, users will have different needs at different times and in different circumstances

For example:

- you might be comfortable doing online shopping but struggle for a specific task like uploading a document or taking a photo with your phone
- you’re visiting an area where there is nearly no signal or simply travelling on a train
- you have hardly any data left on your account, no or slow internet access
- you are applying online to get some support because you have been assaulted, or just lost someone, or about to lose your home

### In Scotland - Digital exclusion
**About 1 in 7 people in Scotland can’t get online.** This is about 800,000 people.

There are various reasons:

- money: can’t afford a device, to pay for broadband/data, or to get the assistive devices they need
- lives in an area with poor infrastructure
- lack confidence to use an online service themselves
- lack digital skills

We usually don't realise how many are affected:
- 2 in 10 adults in Scotland lack basic digital skills
- 1 in 10 have no digital skills (find info, order shopping online or fill in a form)
- 13% of households have no internet access at home (17% for the lowest income households)
- 1 in 8 adults do not use the internet at all

## Inclusion
This is a broader term: Inclusive design is about designing for a diverse range of people. Whatever their gender, sexuality, age, ethnicity, social class, communications abilities or culture.

- if your service is not accessible, then you are not inclusive of people with accessibility needs
- if your service online is accessible, but you don’t offer an alternative for assisted digital users, then you are not inclusive either

### Common inclusion issues in services

For example asking for:
- your gender when it might not even be needed or in a way that doesn’t allow you to identify yourself correctly
- your title or marital status
- parents information in terms which exclude same-sex-parenting
