This is the home of Service Design in Scottish Enterprise.
</p>

<p>
It is here to make us more transparent and to help the sharing of information, practice and learning.
</p>

<p>
We are keen to share how and what we are doing. Copy what you want and tell us if you know better ways of doing stuff :-)
</p>

<p>
There are areas for various Workstreams which will deep dive into their Research & Design.
</p>

<p>
  There is also a <a href="https://scotentSD.github.io/blog/">blog</a> that will cover a lot of the ongoing learning
</p>
